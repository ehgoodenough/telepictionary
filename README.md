Telepictionary is a combination of both [Telephone][1] and [Pictionary][2], where players alternate between describing an image and doodling from text. Although the game is usually played with paper and pen, we want to play it with mouse or stylus!

The project is developed with Javascript on the frontend and PHP with MySQL on the backend. The game is being developed in coordination with the [Chattanooga Game Developers][3]. If you want to contribute to the project, fork us on Github. We would really appreciate your support!
