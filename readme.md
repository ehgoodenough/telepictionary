Telepictionary is a combination of both [Telephone][1] and [Pictionary][2], where players alternate between describing an image and doodling from text. It can be a bit confusing to understand, but after playing through a few sessions, it will make a lot more sense. And it can also be immensely fun! The game was originally played around a table with paper and pen, but could be much more accessible if played across the internet with mouse and keyboard.

At the moment, the project is developed with JavaScript on the frontend and PHP with MySQL on the backend, but later in development, it shouldn't be too difficult to transition to either Ruby on Rails or NodeJS. In the meantime, however, the development of the project is entirely accessible from any apache serverstack, including LAMP, WAMP, MAMP, and XAMPP.

The game is being developed in coordination with the [Chattanooga Game Developers][3]. If you want to contribute to the project, please fork us here on [GitHub][4]!
